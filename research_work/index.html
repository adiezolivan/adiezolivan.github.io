	<h1>Alberto Diez-Olivan, PhD</h1>
	<p>I am a senior data scientist with more than 10 years of experience with machine learning applications. I obtained a Computer Science Engineering degree at Universidad del País Vasco (UPV–EHU) in 2006 and a M.Sc. in Computer Sciences and Artificial Intelligence in 2009 by the same University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Robotics and Automation from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (ETSII-UPM) in 2017, being my thesis related to machine learning methods and applications for data-driven prognostics. That same year I also got the first prize of the EARTO innovation awards in the category of Impact Delivery for my work in the development of the AURA technology, an innovative system which uses Big Data and Machine Learning to predict the expected behavior of a company’s key assets. I entered Fatronik with Iñaki Goenaga Research Fellowship in 2006 and in 2015 I did an internship of 6 months at the NICTA’s machine learning research group in Sydney (Australia), ranked as one of the top five machine language learning units in the world. Nowadays I work as an experienced data scientist in the TECNALIA’s Industry & Transport Division. I have been involved in the design and development of intelligent applications in several R&D projects, both public-funded at European and National level and with important customers, addressing challenging problems related to condition-based monitoring, predictive maintenance, pattern classification, quality and health status estimation and production optimization. My findings have been published in high-impact peer-reviewed journals and presented my work at a number of international conferences.</p>
